This google drive link has the presentations, note, and video recording when I was leading the class in creating the submitter project.
The video recordings are of our meetings to discuss where we are at, what everyone is doing and, how we are getting there.
I couldn't be there for everypart of the meeting like for when teams split up or seperate meeting for other discussions on the project. 
The notes are what I took during class. The presentations are meant to explain what we have done in the 2-4 week scrum (mostly 2 week scrums) of the submitter project.
